  <p><strong><em>Definition:</em></strong> Machine Learning (ML) is the set of all the techniques and algorithms able to extract knowledge from the data, and use that knowledge to make accurate previsions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the definition, it is clear that a good Machine Learning algorithm is always developed by following some steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Understand the task (e.g.  what do we need? what are the informations we are able to collect to answer the question we are asking for?);</li>
  <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Collect a big set of data, containing enough informations to be able to use them to achieve the task above;</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Design the Machine Learning algorithm, based on the knowledge we have on the studied problem;</li>
  <li><strong>Training:</strong> Train the algorithm on the collected data, trying to minimize the prediction error on the given dataset;</li>
  <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> Eventually tune some parameters of the model (a ML algorithm is usually referred to as <em>model</em>) to improve the predictions;</li>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test the algorithm on new data, verifying its ability on making predictions;</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™re going to investigate each of those steps more deeply in the following.</p>

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>
<p>Assume we want to solve a given problem. Mathematically, the problem we aim to solve can be modelled as an (unknown) function $f(x)$, taking as input a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ containing the informations we are able to collect and mapping them (possibly <strong>stocastically</strong>) to the task $y = f(x)$. When this is the case, $x$ is usually called <em>input vector</em> or alternatively <em>feature vector</em>, while $y = f(x)$ is the <em>target</em> (equivalently <em>label</em> or <em>output</em>).</p>

<p><em>Solving</em> the problem means being able to approximate $f(x)$ as good as possible with a model (that we will always indicate as $f_\theta (x)$, $\theta$ being the set of parameters defining it), such that</p>

\[f_\theta(x) \approx f(x) \qquad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d\]

<h3 id="question-1-is-it-learnable">Question 1: Is it learnable?</h3>
<p>A problem $y = f(x)$ can be solved by a ML algorithm if and only if there <strong>exists</strong> a relationship between $x$ and $y$. For example, we cannot expect to predict the future weather in a particular position by using informations about the stock price of a particular company. In that situation, the input and the output are clearly <strong>indepdendent</strong>, and there is no change to learning anything from one using the other.</p>

<p>Consequently, the first point in designing a ML algorithm is to understand <em>if</em> there exists a correlation between the input and the output of the given problem. When this is the case, we say that the problem is <strong>learnable</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is about understanding correlations (patterns).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="question-2-it-is-possible-to-collect-them">Question 2: It is possible to collect them?</h3>
<p>Assume that the problem $y = f(x)$ is learnable. We need to understand if we can physically collect enough data $x$ to be able to understand the relationship between him and its corresponding $y$.</p>

<p>For example, if we want to use ML to make cancer diagnosis on patients, clearly the best way to do that is to use as input the clinical results of any possible medical exam on the patient. Of course, even if this will work well in practice, it is not possible (and expecially not ethic) to test the patient with thousands of exams for a single diagnosis.</p>

<p>Moreover, to train a good ML model, we will need thousands (sometimes milions) of datapoints, and it is not always possible to scale our problem to be able to collect enough data to solve it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collecting data requires <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>scalability</strong> of the problem.</p>
