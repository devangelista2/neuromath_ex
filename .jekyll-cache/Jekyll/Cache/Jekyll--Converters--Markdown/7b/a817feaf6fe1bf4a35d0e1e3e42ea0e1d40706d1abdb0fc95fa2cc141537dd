  <p><strong><em>Definition:</em></strong> Machine Learning (ML) is the set of all the techniques and algorithms able to extract knowledge from the data, and use that knowledge to make accurate previsions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the definition, it is clear that a good Machine Learning algorithm is always developed by following some steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Understand the task (e.g.  what do we need? what are the informations we are able to collect to answer the question we are asking for?);</li>
  <li><strong>Collection</strong>Collect a big set of data, containing enough informations to be able to use them to achieve the task above;</li>
  <li>Design the Machine Learning</li>
</ul>
