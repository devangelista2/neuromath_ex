  <p><strong><em>Definition:</em></strong> Machine Learning (ML) is the set of all the techniques and algorithms able to extract knowledge from the data, and use that knowledge to make accurate previsions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the definition, it is clear that a good Machine Learning algorithm is always developed by following some steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Understand the task (e.g.  what do we need? what are the informations we are able to collect to answer the question we are asking for?);</li>
  <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Collect a big set of data, containing enough informations to be able to use them to achieve the task above;</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Design the Machine Learning algorithm, based on the knowledge we have on the studied problem;</li>
  <li><strong>Training:</strong> Train the algorithm on the collected data, trying to minimize the prediction error on the given dataset;</li>
  <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> Eventually tune some parameters of the model (a ML algorithm is usually referred to as <em>model</em>) to improve the predictions;</li>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test the algorithm on new data, verifying its ability on making predictions;</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™re going to investigate each of those steps more deeply in the following.</p>

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>
<p>Assume we want to solve a given problem. Mathematically, the problem we aim to solve can be modelled as an (unknown) function $f(x)$, taking as input a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ containing the informations we are able to collect and mapping them (possibly <strong>stocastically</strong>) to the task $y = f(x)$.</p>

<p><em>Solving</em> the problem means being able to approximate $f(x)$ as good as possible with a model (that we will always indicate as $f_\theta (x)$, $\theta$ being the set of parameters defining it), such that 
$$
f_\theta(x) \approx</p>
